<h1>When the Sewage Smell Is Coming From Inside the House</h1>
<h2>Sewage leaks and odors should never happen indoors. In some neighborhoods, they almost never do. In Harlem and Central Brooklyn, it's a different story. </h2>

<p>Few smells are as viscerally unpleasant as the stench of raw sewage. But when that smell is inside your own home—as can happen due a plumbing issue in your building, a neighboring one, or the local sewers—it can be impossible to escape.</p> 
<p>"You're just bombarded with poop. You're gonna smell it as you as you come through the door," Makeeba Thompson <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sewage-smell-kingsbridge-heights-bronx-department-of-environmental-protection/">told CBS New York in 2020</a>. "Every day that we get up and we have breakfast, we have breakfast and sewage. We got coffee and sewage. We got dinner with sewage. We go to sleep with sewage."</p>
<p>In Thompson's case, according to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/sewage-smell-kingsbridge-heights-bronx-department-of-environmental-protection/">the CBS report</a>, she had no direct way to fix the problem, which stemmed from the building next door. But she did have a way to <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01068">lodge a formal complaint</a>: by calling 311, the city's all-purpose helpline. That's often the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/realestate/shared-electric-bills-and-rules-in-co-ops-and-rent-stabilization-problems.html">first step</a> in getting a city inspector to sniff around and potentially find a landlord who is <a href="https://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/help-answers/hp-actions-for-repairs-and-services/">violating the city's housing laws</a>.</p>
<p>Complaints to 311 about sewage smells and leaks are made all over New York City, but they are more common in certain neighborhoods. Between 2017 and 2021, there were just five such complaints made in Brooklyn Heights-Cobble Hill and 11 in Gramercy. There were none made in Douglaston, a wealthy suburban neighborhood on the waterfront in Queens. In that same time period, there were 129 sewage complaints made in Crown Heights North, 80 in neighboring Stuyvesant Heights, 91 in East New York, and 83 in Central Harlem North.</p>

<p>Sewage backups are "a matter of environmental justice because they disproportionally harm communities of color and low-income communities," says <a href="https://www.qc.cuny.edu/academics/us/natalie-bump-vena/">Natalie Vena, Ph.D.</a>, an assistant professor in the department of urban studies at Queens College, who has done fieldwork on a <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-south-ozone-park-flood-20201005-u3fl42mytjgn7decttxz6ikpne-story.html">catastrophic sewage backup</a> that happened in 2019 in South Ozone Park.</p> 
<p>What's more, Vena says, neighborhoods like Crown Heights and Central Harlem that have experienced rapid development have sometimes also experienced "disinvestments in community infrastructure." "We're developing, but we're not then updating the sewer lines," says Vena. "There's so much more stress on the infrastructure now."</p>
<p>Ultimately, calls to 311 about sewage smells or leaks may be just a small window into the much larger problem of sewage backups, where apartments and homes can be flooded with raw sewage. According to <a href="https://citylimits.org/2022/10/12/sewer-backups-increasing-from-climate-change-are-costing-citys-homeowners/">reporting by City Limits</a>, the Department of Environmental Protection received 16,521 sewage backup complaints in the most recent fiscal year, a more than 40 percent rise from the year before.</p></div>
